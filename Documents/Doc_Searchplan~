Strategy 1
==========
SPECTRASEARCH--(zone,triggertimes)

(times),(picktimes)-->removeteleseismic-->[picktimes 2]


STEPS
=====
build getcatalog X

build traveltime, check with Allplots X

build simple filter for amplitudes only X
experiment with locations & amplitudes X
add progressively better filters X

build splitter 

modify spectrasearch


NOTES
=====
station lat/lon found in stats

events object only has indication#

epicentral distance: from obspy.core.utils.geodetics import gps2DistAzimuth (meters)
