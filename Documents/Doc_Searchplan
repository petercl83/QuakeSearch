=========
I compared picktimes from Jan-March 2014 from two sources: getcatalog.py and writetrigger.py.  In one case writetrigger caught an earthquake it shouldn't have, and in another case it did not catch a quake that it should have.  RUN program again using this times and pot to see what happened.
