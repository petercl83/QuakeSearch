SPECTRASEARCH-->[starttime,stoptime]-->getcatalog-->[events]-->filtered-->[events]-->traveltime-->[times]

Strategy 1
==========
SPECTRASEARCH--(triggertimes)

(times),(picktimes)-->removeteleseismic-->[picktimes 2]



Strategy 2
==========
[times],[stream]-->splitter-->[streams]-->SPECTRASEARCH-->(triggertimes)


STEPS
=====
build getcatalog

build traveltime, check with Allplots

build simple filter for amplitudes only
experiment with locations & amplitudes
add progressively better filters

build splitter

modify spectrasearch


NOTES
=====
station lat/lon found in stats

events object only has indication#

epicentral distance: from obspy.core.utils.geodetics import gps2DistAzimuth (meters)
